# WTF Comic Panel Repo 🤯

Welcome to the world’s first open-source vault for the weirdest, wildest, most out-of-context comic panels on the planet.

## The Rules
- Submit a single comic panel. Must be weird, out of context, or just plain make no sense.
- No explanation, no setup—just one panel to confuse, amuse, or inspire.
- Drawn, digital, stick figures. All skill levels welcome.
- Submit via Pull Request (PR) or open an Issue and upload your image. Filename it: `username_title.png`
- Optional: Add a 1-2 sentence blurb if it’s just too good not to explain.

## The Game
- Each month, I’ll (or you can) randomly pick 3–5 panels and attempt to stitch them into a coherent comic story, livestream or post the results.
- Best (worst?) panels get added to the **WTF Hall of Fame**.

## How To Submit (No Coding Required)
- Option 1: [Recommended] Click “Issues” above, then “New Issue.” Attach your panel image and add a title. That’s it!
- Option 2: Email your panel to [wtfpanels@gmail.com]
- Option 3: Post your panel on Instagram with #WTFPanel and tag @steviepens. I’ll grab the weirdest and add them in.

Don’t know how to make a Pull Request? No problem! Just use any of the options above.

## What Makes a Great WTF Panel?
- No context, no backstory, no punchline
- The weirder, the better. Go wild.
- Example: A hamster riding a tornado, holding a slice of pizza.

**Let’s make something so weird it can’t help but become legendary.**
